                            like watering your plants - despite the fact that those plants can play a pivotal role
                            in the feng-shui of your home or business. We're here to help make sure your plants
                            never go without water again, allowing you to maintain a bright & vibrant atmosphere

                            Upon signing up and downloading Water My Plants, you'll have the ability to customize the
                            watering and feeding schedule for each selected plant type. You'll be able to log every
                            action you take for any plant you've added to your watering list. More houseplants die every
                            year from improper watering than any other single factor; with Water My Plants, you can be
                            assured that your rooted friends will never meet that fate again. Your plants will thank you!
